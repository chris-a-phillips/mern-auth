<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

<!-- [![Product Name Screen Shot][product-screenshot]](https://example.com) -->

This repository is a template with all of the starter code for a basic MERN application with CRUD functionality and authentication using JSON Web Tokens for authentication.

The main functionalities include:
* An open read models with the ability for all users to read data
* Users can post data and only edit or delete things they have ownership over
* JSON Web Tokens for authentication
* React App designed with Styled Components
* Frontend connected with the backend that includes pages for:
	* Data List Page
	* User Dashboard Page
	* User Post Page
	* User Login Page

This particular app is based off of a job board. There are a lot of comments that can be used to edit and change things on the backend so that it works exactly how you want it. I am currently still working on connecting them both (mostly the frontend code) and putting in all of the functionality so that they work well together. After that I will go back and add comments so that it is easier to see how the components are connected.
